# MUST Use lowercase separate words with hyphens for Path Segments

Example:

``` http
/shipment-orders/<shipment-order-id>
```

This applies to concrete path segments and not the names of path
parameters. For example `{shipment_order_id}` would be ok as a path
parameter.

# MUST Use snake_case for Query Parameters

Examples:

    customer_number, order_id, billing_address

# MUST Pluralize Resource Names

Usually, a collection of resource instances is provided (at least API
should be ready here). The special case of a resource singleton is a
collection with cardinality 1.

# MUST Avoid Trailing Slashes

The trailing slash must not have specific semantics. Resource paths must
deliver the same results whether they have the trailing slash or not.

# MUST Stick to Conventional Query Parameters

If you provide query support for searching, sorting, filtering, and
paginating, you must stick to the following naming conventions:

  - `q` — default query parameter (e.g. used by browser tab completion);
    should have an entity specific alias, like sku

  - `sort` — comma-separated list of fields
    to define the sort order. To indicate sorting direction, fields may
    be prefixed with `+` (ascending) or `-` (descending), e.g.
    /sales-orders?sort=+id

  - `fields` — to retrieve only a subset of fields of a resource.

  - `embed` — to expand or embed sub-entities (ie.: inside of an
    article entity, expand silhouette code into the silhouette object).
    Implementing `embed` correctly is difficult, so do it with care.

  - `offset` — numeric offset of the first element on a page. See
    [pagination](pagination.md) section.

  - `limit` — client suggested limit to restrict the number of entries
    on a page. See [pagination](pagination.md) section.
